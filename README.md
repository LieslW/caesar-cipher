# LAB - Class 18  

## Project: Cryptography  
## Author: Liesl White  

Received help from Tanesha Brester: She and I were having a similar error in which when we tried implementing our code, it kept returning a "No module named corpus_loader.py". I even downloaded the demo lab and made sure I installed all the right files and it still doesn't work.
